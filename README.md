# ShopSmart
A smart shopping tool to effortlessly and efficiently manage your shopping lists for all of your favorite stores.

## Product Details
#### Vision Statement
We aim to bring a unique, automated solution to the shopping experience.Â  Managing common household item preferences and tracking key retailers has never been easier.

#### Motivation
Many of us have felt the annoyance and tedium of managing several shopping lists in our phone's Notes app, switching between lists to put a product on the most recent list for the right store, and somehow always forgetting where you bought a particular item you want to re-purchase. We want to fix this by providing consumers a shopping tool that remembers what store you bought something from and automatically assigns items to the correct list when you need them again.
