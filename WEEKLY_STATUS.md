### Date: 10/15/2025

Update: This week we began prioritizing issues in Trello. While we're still in the beginning stages of the ShopSmart design, we discussed MVP for the web pages, the backend, and the database. We have dividied up some of the work based on our confidence and experience levels, while still keeping some issues as a team effort. We are continuing to have weekly meetings to discuss our progress and we remain active in Discord for team communication.
