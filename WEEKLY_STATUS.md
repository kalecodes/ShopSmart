### Date 10/30/2025

Update: This week as a team, we went over the work that was completed for the web page designs. The web pages are currently in a wireframe state, but contain everything we need to begin developing and styling the pages. We also discussed the SQL database that we began implementing. We have started the initial phases of database development, with a database that contains four tables, all necessary for our app. 

For this upcoming week, we are beginning work on the backend. As a team we are looking into different methods that will allow our frontend webpages to communicate with our backend, which will ultimately communicate with our database. This is the next big task we're looking to begin development on as this will be the step that ties all the pieces together. This work will continue for the next couple weeks.

### Date: 10/15/2025

Update: This week we began prioritizing issues in Trello. While we're still in the beginning stages of the ShopSmart design, we discussed MVP for the web pages, the backend, and the database. We have dividied up some of the work based on our confidence and experience levels, while still keeping some issues as a team effort. We are continuing to have weekly meetings to discuss our progress and we remain active in Discord for team communication.
